# CSS Calc() Function Space Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The problem arises from forgetting to include spaces around the operators within the calculation.

The `bug.css` file contains the incorrect code, leading to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the correct implementation.

**Key Learning:** Always ensure spaces are added between the values and operators within the `calc()` function to avoid errors and ensure accurate calculations.
