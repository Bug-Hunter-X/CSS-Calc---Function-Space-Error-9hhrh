The correct usage of `calc()` requires spaces around the operators.  Here's how to fix the issue:

```css
/* Incorrect */
width: calc(100%-10px);

/* Correct */
width: calc(100% - 10px);
```

By adding spaces between `100%`, `-`, and `10px`, the calculation is correctly parsed.  This ensures that the width is calculated as 100% of the container minus 10 pixels.
